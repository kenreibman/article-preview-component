## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I spent literally DAYS trying to learn JavaScript so I can create a simple social media share pop-up. I still do not think I did it the correct way... but this is all part of the learning process.
